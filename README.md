# IrregularBox

Fourteen percent of women suffer the discomfort of irregular periods. The object of this project is to measure, record and analyze the basal temperature of a woman's body and to accurately model and so predict the timing of key stages in the cycle. A satisfactory conclusion to the project would mean that women would be given notice of their commencement of menstruation, fertility etc. Measurement and recording is achieved by an infrared skin temperature sensor which is logged and time stamped to a SD card and the recorded package is then an uploaded via the Internet to a mobile application for analysis and interpretation. During the analysis stage the mobile application endeavors to look for subtle changes in temperature. These temperature changes are mapped against the standard menstrual curve looking for pattern recognition.


This project incorporates the electronic design of sensors, arduino programming, prototyping and 3d printing the product case, screen prototyping of the associated Mobile Application and basic analysis of recorded data to identify the key moments of the menstrual cycle and thus be able to predict these stages in future cycles.


In the long-term the analysis stage would be developed to incorporate artificial intelligence utilizing the growing amount of data recorded about an individual and so further increasing the accuracy of prediction. If this simple-to-use recording mechanism was utilized over a wide spectrum of the female population the joint data accumulated could help to identify, diagnose and understand further the intricacies of a woman's reproductive cycle and possibly the diseases that afflict so many
